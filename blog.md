Not quite Day 0 - I  began doing tiny bits and pieces of this path a week or so ago but my progress has been slow as I've had a few other short-term priorities pressing on my time (and my mind!)

### A Bit About Me

 I've always been interested in computers and technology - as a child from about the age of six I would teach everyone in the house how to use the microwave (it was a fancy grill/oven combo), or programme the VCR. We got our first computer, which ran on DOS, rather than Windows and I learned how to use it to run basic text games and word processing. 
 
 Because of a lack of formal education options, I never took it any further. ICT classes at school taught you how to use MS Office, and I'd already figured that out. I did enjoy Maths and Science - I was good at both (yay, aspie brain) and had aspirations to study Maths and Physics after GCSE. I didn't have plans for university, but was happy to spend a bit more time studying things I was interested in. School had other ideas - due to a timetable clash, I could only do Maths _or_ Physics. I opted for Maths, along with French and German. I loved part of Maths - Pure Maths was brilliant. But I hated Statistics and thought Decision and Discrete Maths was just plain weird. 
 
 I left school a year later at 17, running off to marry some bloke I met on the Internet (not the done thing in 2002 - most people you met online were weirdoes or psychos) and after getting married, soon after entered the world of work at 18. We're still married, by the way :)
 
### What I've Been Up To So Far
 
 15 years on, I've wound up working in a job in Digital Marketing, which I really enjoy. Ironically, a big chunk of my work involves doing statisticy things, which I don't dislike. I look for problems shown by the data and I work to fix them. I'm good at it. But I can see what way the future is going. Increasingly people are going to need to be able to code and be more technologically equipped. There's also areas of my job where a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript would be really useful.
 
 A little while ago, I started a HTML/CSS course on Codecademy. I also had a training session on the same at work, which taught me less than the first using of the Codecademy course. Go figure! But then you get busy and it slips because you don't make it a priority. I'm not sure what triggered me to look at this again before Christmas, but I began thinking about it again and couldn't stop. A bit of Googling eventually led me to Free Code Camp, the forum and a great series of posts by one of their users on how to start studing either CS with Web Dev, or focus on Web Dev with a bit of CS. Being a mega nerd I love the idea of understanding more about CS in general so this is the path I've gone for.
 
 I've already completed some of the FCC curriculum - some of the HTML, CSS and basic Bootstrap and jQuery units. There's some simple projects I need to complete, one of which I've started on already before I kick off Javascript. I've started reading the YDKJS books and I'm getting familiar with using Github. I'm cheating and using Github desktop, rather than the command line. I'll get there eventually, but I use Windows rather than a Mac, so I' going to wait to look at Linux etc later. I bought myself a lovely new notebook from [Code & Quill](https://www.codeandquill.com/) in which to store my notes, ideas and project work. I've learned how Markdown works and that's what I'm going to use for writing these updates.
 
 So what's next? I'm going to knock up a Trello board for all of things I'm going to do (I know there is one already, but I have other stuff I want to add to mine), and catch up on notetaking for the Bootstrap and jQuery lessons I've done. Then, I might try and finish the Tribute page I've started before moving onto the recommended part of the course. To begin with my progress might be a little slow, as I've got other commitments that I need to get to the end of first, but once that's done I'm hoping to move forward quickly.
 
 If you're on your own learning journey, good luck to you! If you're several months/years down the road, it'd be great to hear any hints/tips/feedback that you might have.
