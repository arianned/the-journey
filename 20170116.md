I'm making progress on the Trello board! It's not quite done yet - I just need to add the final tier of content to it. But all of the bookmarks, resources etc are included, plus some of the elective items I'd like to look at to further boost my knowledge. I may decide I don't need these items as I progress, but we'll see.

You can find the board here: [CS & Web Dev Comprehensive Study Path Template](https://trello.com/b/9AMPQVuP/cs-web-dev-comprehensive-study-path-template). Feel free to copy it to your own boards and adapt as needed (once it's done of course :) )
