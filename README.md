## What This Is

And what this is not! For the first time in my life I'm really seriously going to attempt to learn to code, rather than just dabble at it. I'm following the suggested course of tuition outlined [here][link to tute] on Free Code Camp. One of the suggested actions is to,
  >* take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned  
* build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting  
* if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate

So that's what this is about. I'm going to take notes, blog and build tiny things to test my knowledge. I'll have a little blog thing, notes on books I read and folders for stuff I build. This may evolve over time, but right now, that's my plan! Nothing ground-breaking, or possibly very interesting. More just a way for me to chart my progress.
